    27.                 Calibration
</h1>
<p>
    Adrift again. Falling, more like sinking. That’s how water  worked, and this
    was sort of like that. Tossed straight into the abyss, not  what she wanted.
    Her stone  sank in an impossible pond, surprisingly shallow and unnervingly
    deep. Everything  smelled like colors. She could taste them too. Rainbows
    were not delicious, red  stung like blood and dental pain. The candy
    industry lied; she wanted a refund  for her whole life. She’d call to
    complain, but she had no mouth, or anything else, and no one was  here to
    listen.
</p>
<p>
    Alone again. This wasn’t how it was supposed to work. Something  about
    having a guide. Whatever this was, it was a dumb idea, so of course it  came
    from her boss.
</p>
<p>
    What was it again? The idea? The one that wasn’t working. Nora  tried to
    replay how she’d arrived. Followed a meeting link that took her across  the
    bay, over the gateway bridge. No, the grey one. Entered a tower, edges like
    sharp glass, familiar from a distance, alien novelty inside. Zaree got them
    in.  Made a telephone call, spoke the magic words: free consultation. Opened
    the  door. Like a hacker, or a wizard. Nora should’ve been impressed, but
    now she  was just pissed.
</p>
<p>
    She remembered seeing herself when she stepped through the  door. It was
    only the first weird feeling. Except it wasn’t her, rather a  shadow of her
    old otherself, flesh stitched from fresh matterprinter resin. Its  sharp
    smell stung her nose, brought back memories. She’d had one of these on  her
    desk, tiny, in a shoebox somewhere now. This was lifesize, like life, only
    in need of a fresh coat.
</p>
<p>
    Mayalinn.
</p>
<p>
    It was a puppet. No, Nora was the puppet, this was a statue.  Maya
    triumphant. Saved the city, never mind the backstory. Center of the verse,
    eye of the storm. That’s where she was right now, where her shadow had
    stayed.
</p>
<p>
    Jack. Must’ve been his idea. Hijacked Zaree’s good  intentions, met them at
    the door. Hi, Jack. Good one, save that for later. Printed  a Mayalinn to
    impress her, stuck it in the entrance of his tower to greet her. See  a
    statue of yourself in the lobby, how can you say no? Trojan horse in
    reverse;  gift got her past his gate, now trapped inside.
</p>
<p>
    Meant he needed her for something. She fell for it, so  stupid in
    retrospect. This whole trip had been his idea.
</p>
<p>
    Trip. Inverse, in-verse, inside-out and inverted in the  verse.
</p>
<p>
    This was drugs. Except Nora didn’t do drugs, not so hot  about video games
    anymore. Now she was on drugs, inside Jack’s video game. At  least she could
    say it was for work.
</p>
<p>
    Abhishek called it a great opportunity. They’d do some  consulting work for
    Sandstorm’s new MI, pro bono. Nora could get certified for  exascale.
    KorBridge would get in the door, the partnership her boss always  wanted.
    The mythical win-win-win, as long as you weren’t the pro being bonoed.
</p>
<p>
    No bueno. Felt like she was losing the game. Remembered  sinking through the
    floor, into the dungeon. No, the Basement. Took the  elevator down after the
    business talk. Blah blah, Zaree’s PowerPoint: KorBridge  was here to help.
    Turns out Nora was here to get used. In the basement, she  went into the
    white room.  So clean, so smooth. Like her brain right now, no bumps at all.
    This was  supposed to be a short trip, intro dose. Felt more like a soft
    reboot. Maybe if  she wasn’t the only person in this fucking town who hadn’t
    tripped before. Not  calibrated properly. Calibrated. Caleb. Guy who gave
    her the drugs. Kind looks.  Calm, like a cult leader, handed her the cup
    with her tablet. Like the guy  giving out the kool-aid.
</p>
<p>
    That’s what she was swimming in, tasting it in her mouth. Not  blood
    anymore, bitter iron swapped for fake sweet, pure red. But it meant she  had
    a mouth now. Progress.
</p>
<p>
    Stopped sinking, started swimming. Can’t swim without arms,  meant she had
    those too. Very cool. Moving up now, not drowning in her own impulse.  Might
    start thinking in complete sentences someday, be a whole person again.
    That’d  be great, being something other than a shadow.
</p>
<p>
    Just don’t get invested, sold into Jack’s scheme. Don’t get  hooked like a
    phish.
</p>
<p>
    Saw her shadow as she rose up out of the pool, crawled into  the corner of
    the cell. Needed legs to crawl; cool, crossed those off the list  of missing
    limbs. The corner was cold, stone walls, she’d been put in her place.
    Somewhere familiar yet forgotten.
</p>
<p>
    Turned back to the puddle she crawled out of, no rainbow,  just a leaky
    crypt. Turned again, saw Caleb standing over her. Priest robes,  stone grey,
    red stole. Skull necklace, strange beads in his beard. Doom Cleric.  Servant
    of the Sleeping Gods. Made sense, or was her mind making it all up?
</p>
<p>
    She had legs but was still trying to find her feet. Worn boots,  wasn’t
    naked. That’d be weird. “This is too much. This was supposed to be a  short
    trip,” she said.
</p>
<p>
    “Jack said you were a hero. You said you were in a hurry. I  gave you the
    heroic dose,” Caleb admitted without malice.
</p>
<p>
    “Could’ve killed me,” she replied, tasting spite on her  tongue, another
    flavor of red. She’d forgotten about the urgency. Was this her  idea? Better
    to keep blaming Jack or Abhishek; ideas this bad were always  management’s
    fault.
</p>
<p>
    “There is no known lethal limit. Believe me, I’d be dead,”  Caleb said in
    shallow tones.
</p>
<p>
    “Still, I’m not familiar with pharmaceuticals. Barely take  Tylenol.” Then
    she remembered something about someone being sick.
</p>
<p>
    “But you are quite familiar with the Stormverse, and that’s  half the
    battle. Where are we, Nora?”
</p>
<p>
    She looked around the room. A rusty rapier rested against unfinished  brick.
    Looked down, torn vest, tattered leggings, scuffed boots. Fingerless  gloves
    falling apart. “The Queen’s Stockades,” she said. Shadowblades started  as
    thieves before learning magic later. It’d been so long she’d forgotten her
    own origin story. Mayalinn’s story. She was her, the shadow she left behind,
    same as the statue Jack used for his scheme. “I’m in prison for a crime I
    didn’t commit.”
</p>
<p>
    The symbolism wasn’t lost, neither was she, not anymore. Starter  dungeon,
    simple layout, shaped like a T. As if floating from above, she could  see it
    in her mind. That’s what this was, her mind’s eye negotiating a  connection.
    Building a link, laying down a protocol. Her sensorium syncing up  with
    StormGEN-03. The new new user experience.
</p>
<p>
    Her fingers reached for the rapier’s grip. With weapon in  hand, ghostly
    hieroglyphics flickered just out of view—inch-high icons of  slashing
    swords, magic missiles, little lightning bolts all off to the left. Training
    wheels, or just a joke? Her attention brought them center stage. Action
    buttons, the old interface, before haptics got good, before grip controllers
    translated every interaction. Every wish. Absolutely archaic in the age of
    AI. “I  don’t need the tutorial,” she said to Caleb, banishing the buttons
    back to the  periphery.
</p>
<p>
    “You do. You might have wasted years of your life in the  verse, but you
    never took a fencing lesson. And you’re not a wizard, no matter  how often
    you still imagine yourself to be.”
</p>
<p>
    How could he know? Was this guy for real or another case of Nora’s  mind
    mocking itself?  Either way, he was  inside her head.
</p>
<p>
    Time to get him out. Trying to strike, she swished at air. Clumsy  dork,
    felt like a fool.
</p>
<p>
    “Trust me Nora, this isn’t a puzzle you can figure out in  five minutes. You
    need to build muscle memory, learn your limits, associate  intention with
    action. You’re not the first person I’ve taken on the tour.”
</p>
<p>
    “Did you throw them all in your dungeon?”
</p>
<p>
    “No. Most were artists, our worldsmiths. I had to teach them  how to paint
    by numbers like they were children, so we used a classroom in the  castle.
    But they wanted to learn so it wasn’t a contest, though some are still
    struggling.” He sighed, acutely exhausted. Not Nora’s fault, for once.
</p>
<p>
    She lunged at him. Or tried, sticking out her arm and barely  budging. He
    swatted the tip of her blade with his blood-colored glove, brushing  her
    aside, “You’ve set me up as your adversary. So hostile, but I promise we’re
    on the same side. I’ve read all your papers, always wanted to work with
    you.”  Flattery. If he was going to push her buttons, she should push one of
    his. Glancing  toward an icon, she flinched,  pressed against the roof of
    her mouth and puffed like a quadriplegic.
</p>
<p>
    Only then did she understand the truth: she was strapped in  a chair back in
    reality, wired up to every digit. Band pulled over her eyes,  plugs in her
    ears, mouthpiece to stop from swallowing her tongue.
</p>
<p>
    Something clicked. She struck his shoulder, slashed at his  stole, watched
    red cloth fall to the floor. Kept pressing that button, left  hand going
    through the motions, attacking like autotune and landing uninspired  hits.
    Tore a hole through his chest—a trivial triumph. Still felt good watching
    him crumple to the stone, staring as blood chased along the cracks. Looked
    up  after hearing metal on metal; made her teeth hurt again. Opening the
    cell,  Caleb stepped over his own corpse.
</p>
<p>
    He came carrying a steel rod this time. Two meters, tall as  he was. Knew
    how to use it too—hit Nora where her neck integrated into her  torso.
    Instant migraine, felt like her head would roll into the next cell. As
    Caleb moved to strike her chest, she reached for the rod with her right
    hand,  clicked the button with the purple spark.
</p>
<p>
    CRACK.
</p>
<p>
    The shock disarmed him—his steel hit stone still sparking. Seeing  him
    stumble, her fist flew at his face. Should’ve landed a good punch, found
    herself fumbling for his collar instead. “If you’re not my enemy, why dress
    like one?” Nora asked as she got a grip and snapped at him.
</p>
<p>
    Caleb grinned like a kid keeping secrets, smug creases  visible beneath his
    beard. “Suffering is your guiding star, Nora. Did you  expect me to take you
    to dinner?” he asked while reaching to retrieve, but not  before Nora
    knocked his rod away with her heel. That stunt was rewarded with a  chop to
    her core, his strike stinging her sternum. Stunned, her heart skipped.
    Searing  spread to her extremities.
</p>
<p>
    Nora bore through the pain. She tried pushing it out of  bounds, beyond the
    stupid buttons. “Why does everything hurt so much? I thought  drugs were
    supposed to be fun.”
</p>
<p>
    “You know why, Nora. Probably read my paper on it.”
</p>
<p>
    Maya winced, still seething. “If I did, it wasn’t  memorable,” she said with
    intent to sting. Was this a duel or a debate? No  reason it couldn’t be
    both. “But I get the point; pain is a high-priority,  low-latency channel,
    hooked up to all the important places.”
</p>
<p>
    “If you want to learn how to feel in this world, it has to  hurt first,”
    Caleb said with practiced prose.
</p>
<p>
    He was right; pain had a way of teaching immediate lessons. But  scars could
    tell tales communicated across time. She swiped at his eye with the  rusty
    rapier, slicing from brow to beard. There was no button for that, it had
    happened on her intention. She knew her boundaries now, where Mayalinn ended
    and the verse began—her edge was where the pain stopped.
</p>
<p>
    Caleb, meanwhile, kept leaking from his face. Not just blood  but tears. His
    hand glowed dark, touched the flesh and sealed it shut, trying  to unlearn
    her lesson. By the time his eyes opened again, he was locked in his  own
    cage, Mayalinn tearing down the hall.
</p>
<p>
    Wet footsteps echoed until she reached the intersection,  stopping to
    survey. The city was up the stairs in one direction, but leaving  now was
    bad karma; one never abandons a dungeon before beating the boss.
</p>
<p>
    Her attention turned down the remaining path. Three guards  rushed in her
    direction, brandishing freshly forged sabers crafted from the  Queen’s
    steel. She collected her pain into a ball of building heat. Fire had  always
    felt unrefined to Maya, too imprecise in a world of wooden ships and
    unstable powder, but for now it made for a fine focus to release her rage.
    She  sent a stream of flares fanning down the hall, setting the trio’s
    tabards  alight.
</p>
<p>
    The guards flailed as flames licked their tunics, but Nora  wasn’t one to
    let advantage go unpressed. She stepped forward, plunging her  rapier
    through the first chest. As he fell, she snatched the saber from his  grasp
    and spun to parry strikes from the remaining two. So long starter weapon;
    hello stolen steel. Cold air crackled across Maya’s arm, her excitement
    electric. Unlike oxidized junk, this blade could conduct.
</p>
<p>
    Steel sparked against steel as she battled both guards at  once, channeling
    Maya’s magic along the blade. When one overextended, she  severed his hand
    at the wrist. The weapon fell from his fingers, reclaimed by Mayalinn
    levitating it into her free hand. Now brandishing both, she made short work
    of  the last, slashing his stomach while simultaneously slitting his throat.
</p>
<p>
    She tapped the blades together, hers now. The icons flipped  and shifted,
    representing new capabilities. So unnecessary; Nora needed no reminder  what
    moves Maya was capable of, all flooding back from five years gone. Wishing
    these distractions away, she strode down the final hall, past empty cells
    and  mold-covered corpses, surprised to see the Silent Queen’s prison in
    such a  sorry state. The hall’s smell shocked her most; the metaverse was
    not supposed  to stink. At the end awaited a door banded with black iron.
    Peeking in provoked  unexpected dread, a sense of something hard to process.
    Those dissonant echoes  of half-familiar madness crept in again, crawling
    along her neck.
</p>
<p>
    Caleb came up behind her. “Don’t go unprepared. What’s in  there wasn’t in
    the tutorial.”
</p>
<p>
    Maya turned back. “I thought you wanted to hurt me. Why  would you care?”
</p>
<p>
    Coarse but sincere, Caleb replied, “I’d rather you didn’t  die.”
</p>
<p>
    “Will it kill me IRL?” Nora asked unsettled.
</p>
<p>
    Caleb squinted. “No, that’s stupid. This is a California  company, we’ve got
    OSHA to deal with,” Caleb said. “But it would be a pain to  put Maya back
    together again. Guest users aren’t supposed to die in the  development
    environment.”
</p>
<p>
    She looked down at the scraps she wore, fit for a day one  newb.
    Under-protected and in over her head. Nora knew better, yet let limbic
    longing command the cold dopamine of old addiction. Hooked in and freed from
    the unfamiliar, their systems now in sync, all of Maya’s old tricks on
    offer. Flexing  fingers forced damp air to chill around her chest, creating
    a shell of fleeting  frost. Her saber sparked an affixed torch to life,
    flickering yellow glow cast  long shadows in the cells behind. Drawing them
    in with a twist of her wrist,  Maya bent the darkness about her body until
    sheathed in nebulous shroud. Knowing  these wards wouldn’t last, she dashed
    through the door.
</p>
<p>
    Torchlight  traced in behind her, ambient rays revealing a large stone
    chamber occluded  only by Maya's diffuse silhouette. Shackled to an anchor
    was a shuffling  soldier, covered by a blood-caked coat, stuck in the center
    of the room. Bound  by the leg with weapon in hand, a gas mask meshed with
    warped lips while  letting its lenses expose empty eyes. As Maya approached,
    it shifted in place,  raising a hacked and butchered barrel. A blast of
    buckshot flew at the level of  her face. Reflexively she slid sideways,
    stepping out of sync with her shadow  before rematerializing five feet to
    her left. Her maneuver caught Caleb’s  surprise as he stepped in behind her.
</p>
<p>
    The soldier shifted again, firing toward her chest. Her  frozen shell
    shattered as it absorbed most of the spray, but stray shot tore  her
    shoulder through thin leather. Maya reached forward with her uninjured arm
    to shock the gun from the soldier’s hand, only to find her trick was
    pointless;  weapon and man were one, stuck together at the stock. It lurched
    and swung its other  arm. Thick, mistaken fingers extended and split into
    six slick tendrils shielded  in sallow grey scales, the drooling pink of
    fresh flesh thirsting between. Their  unexpected heft struck Maya at the
    waist and tossed her to the wall, her impact  accompanied by the sound of
    crunching bone.
</p>
<p>
    The soldier started aiming toward where she lay.
</p>
<p>
    Switching tactics, a stream of icy daggers flew from between  her fingers,
    freezing the mechanism before it could fire another shot. Caleb  stepped
    forward and brought down his steel staff, smashing the brittle barrel and
    buying Maya time to float to her feet. The soldier swung towards her again,
    but  both her blades were ready. Her lower guard deflected, the higher came
    down and  cut deep. Pink bits fell to the floor. The remaining tendrils
    reeled back. A vulnerability  lay exposed, opportunity for Maya to feint and
    lunge forward. Charging through  the monster’s mask, a shock rang along her
    saber. The left lens cracked and snapped  with a pop as smoke escaped the
    socket. The soldier’s gun-arm went limp while  the tendrils twisted inward,
    regenerating the pink flesh by filling in with  tiny triangles. She severed
    the tangle completely, only to watch the cleaved  half crawl away in futile
    fits.
</p>
<p>
    Caleb touched her shoulder where the shot had scoured it,  starting the
    healing process. She withdrew her steel from the soldier’s skull  and peeled
    away the mask, finding a scrawny thing that looked not entirely  unlike
    herself, but with sickly skin and grossly greased curls bound beneath  the
    strap. Once her shoulder stopped stinging, she shrugged off Caleb’s touch,
    claiming the creature’s ill-fitting overcoat by snapping it clean. It wasn’t
    Maya’s Victorian vintage duster, but it had a stark style of its own with
    big brass  buttons. Another snap tailored her trophy taut. Satisfied, she
    slumped against  the stone. “It’s wretched, and doesn’t quite fit with the
    theme,” she said, poking  the creature’s face with her blade to gauge
    vitality and lividity. “Who made them?”
</p>
<p>
    Caleb shook his head. “A kid claimed credit for the first  hack, but now
    they’re cropping up all over and spreading by themselves. Jack wanted  a
    fresh set of eyes.”
</p>
<p>
    “When’d it start?” Nora asked, slipping into clinical assessment.
</p>
<p>
    “After Blightfin Bay crashed on stream. Mostly in older  zones like Feral
    Vale and Thunderbrush Thicket. Stormseye is still safe.”
</p>
<p>
    So, Diego’s suspicions might be right about the timeline. “Jack  can’t be
    happy,” she said, crouching by the body and inspecting what was left  of its
    writhing limb.
</p>
<p>
    “No, loved it. ‘Great content!’ he said, until they started  showing up
    here. Infecting his billion-dollar baby.”
</p>
<p>
    Maya circled the corpse, examining from every angle. “Hell  of an
    introduction. You’re sure bad training data didn’t sneak in from the
    compromised clusters?” Training data. Of course. “Shit, that’s how you know
    so  much about me,” she said, snapping back towards him.
</p>
<p>
    Caleb nodded. “Everything Maya ever did, touched, or said,  all stored in
    our datachains, back to the beginning. That feed was fed into  StormGEN-03
    during the initial training run. Your story is part of hers.”
</p>
<p>
    Nora wanted to protest, but she was sure she’d signed her  self away with a
    checkbox back when she was sixteen. “03 is a her?”
</p>
<p>
    Caleb shrugged. “Not old enough to choose, I know. Doesn’t  even have a
    persona yet, just a bundle of sensation crying out for more. But  we’ve been
    making bets, and I know what my money is on.”
</p>
<p>
    “So, you what? Read my SparkNotes? Got me all figured out?”
</p>
<p>
    “Mayalinn Noramancer was, is, a complex character. Storms of  Steel wouldn’t
    be the same without the time you spent here. By blending that  with all
    available data on Nora Pierce, including your research, you weren’t  hard to
    decipher.”
</p>
<p>
    “Alright, tell me my score,” Maya said, shaking her head.
</p>
<p>
    “You hate yourself. Push yourself just to punish yourself.”
</p>
<p>
    Fuck. All that therapy when all she needed to do was ask an  exascale AI and
    a weird guy with a beard. She shrugged, wishing it were so  simple. Coughing
    green and croaking wet, the soldier’s head fell sideways. Maya’s  blade
    tilted it back to face her, asking, “What are you?”
</p>
<p>
    “The future,” it spit, and died. <br clear="all"/>
